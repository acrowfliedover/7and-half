# 7and-half
1st assignment from Pic 10C

This project is aiming to create a Mexican game similar to Black Jack calle dsiete y medio' (seven and a half).
The main focus is practicing using git/version control software.

Footnotes:

The first part of the project was done in a wrong way, so only the code is left but not the commits.
About merging, I probably did not merge correctly since it does not illustrate the branches as branched out and merging back.
